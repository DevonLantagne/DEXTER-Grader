The secondary goal of DEXTER is to provide insights into student performance.\n This is not a unified gradebook. DEXTER acts on individual assignments/exams; you will need a new DEXTER project per assignment. Projects are initialized using a class list and rubric file. See the User Guide on how to find, create, or format these files.\nDEXTER is a ""standalone"" MATLAB App. To use a standalone MATLAB app, you need the MATLAB Runtime. When you install DEXTER, the runtime will also be installed if it is not already on your computer. DEXTER is currently only supported on Windows OS.";
