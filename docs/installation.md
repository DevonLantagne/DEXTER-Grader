# How to Install DEXTER Grader

## About
DEXTER Grader is a "standalone" MATLAB App. To use a standalone MATLAB app, you need the **MATLAB Runtime**. If you do not have the MATLAB Runtime, the DEXTER Grader Installer will install it for you.  

DEXTER Grader is currently only supported on Windows OS.

## Installing MATLAB Runtime
1. Navigate to the [Executables folder](/executables).
2. Select, download, and execute *DEXTER Installer X_X_X.exe* for the version of your choice.
3. Step through the installation wizard. You can install DEXTER anywhere on your machine.
4. After installation, you can dispose of the installer .exe.
